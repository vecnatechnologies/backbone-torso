/* PERSPECTIVE VIEW
  This is a perspective view. It acts kind of like a web page in
  that the router will move from one perspective view to another
  based on unique urls.

  Theres nothing special about a view being used as a perspective
  except the router is responsible for attaching this view to the DOM.

  /* THAT'S IT
   You don't need any extra boilerplate code to get this view to render
   properly. You just need a template so the view will generate some DOM

/* ONLY ONE
  Typically a perspective view is only instantiated once. You can
  see it is instantiated and immediately returned.
